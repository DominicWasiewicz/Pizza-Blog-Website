        Superpoint is more than a pizza joint. It's the brainchild of Jesse Fader and Jonny Poon of Bar Fancy and functions as a pretty amazing wine bar with a great Italian-inspired menu.
        <br><br>They appeal to Italian food fans and wine drinkers alike with a selection of natural and biodynamic wines, offering accessible dishes while not being afraid to do a burger.
        <br><br>It's pretty small with five tiny tables and a bar, but I kind of like the crowded feel in the extreme low lighting with dashes of neon and kitsch everywhere. The tigers that peek around every corner are a playful nod to the decor at Bar Fancy, where a neon tiger marks the entrance.
        <br><br>We kick things off with a Toronto cocktail ($14). Heavy rye is lifted by bright and licorice-y Frenet, an amaro that's a favourite among industry workers which may taste like cold medicine at first but quickly becomes addictive with a herbaceous profile.
        <br><br>We nosh on a spring roll appetizer ($10), shrimp and pork wrapped in house-made dough, served with sweet and sour chili sauce.
        <br><br>Superpoint's peach and tomato salad ($14) rests on a huge dollop of burrata (the peaches having been preserved for their use beyond August, crunchy, tart and firm) with basil and gorgonzola.
        <br><br>Those who like radicchio will love the grilled radicchio salad ($12), a super tart mix of radicchio and escarole dressed vinaigrette and topped with a mountain of sharp pecorino.
        <br><br>A rich beef reginette ($16) is reasonably priced for the level of saucy beef cheek the house made pasta is swimming in, long ruffled ribbons that break apart at random points making some pieces longer and some shorter. This is all in a light tomato sauce and topped with a healthy heap of parm.
        <br><br> Whole pizza pies are served onto a stand at your table that's high enough to fit a tall can underneath. Pizzas are written on the board, not the menu, and tonight there's a capicollo with olives on offer for $17.
        <br><br>The house dough goes through a twenty hour cold ferment in the fridge, making for a light and crispy crust that holds its shape and cradles sharp cheese, savoury ham, and salty olives.
