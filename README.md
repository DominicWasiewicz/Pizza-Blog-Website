# Pizza-Blog-Website

This is a website I made in one of my classes in school that discusses the best pizza places in Toronto. The home page displays the top six pizza places in the six (Toronto) and the user is able to clock any of the six images to read more about it. The home page has interactive components that generate feedback to the user that they are hovering a link to the article of their choosing. Each image takes the user to one of six articles where the pizza place is discussed in detail such as their history, location, menu, adresss, etc. The user is able to navigate back to the home page and read more articles posted.
