## Description

This is a website I made in one of my classes in school that discusses the best 
pizza places in Toronto. The home page displays the top six pizza places in the six (Toronto) and 
the user is able to clock any of the six images to read more about it. The home page has 
interactive components that generate feedback to the user. Each image takes the user to one of 
six articles where the pizza place is discussed in detail such as their history, location, menu, adresss, etc.
The user is able to navigate back to the home page and read more articles posted.
