        Top Six Pizza Joints In The Six

      The best pizza in Toronto is now arguably rivalling some of the best in the 
      other great pizza cities of the world. Not defined by rigid restrictions or 
      unwavering tradition yet still guided by the lessons of the past, the pizzaiolos 
      of Toronto are doing their best to perfect every aspect of a favourite comfort 
      food, from sauce to crust and beyond.

          1. Maker Pizza (Avenue Road)
        </p>
        <p>
          Here you'll find pizzas of biblical proportions with perfect leoparding 
          on stretchy crusts and toppings from simple double pepperoni to pulled 
          pork to zucchini. There's even Montreal smoked meat on a dine-in-only 
          option at two locations of this takeout restaurant.

        <p>
          Locations of this thin crust mini-chain are often tucked inside or under 
          other businesses, as in the Church-Wellesley Village or on Geary. The 
          Killer Bee has sausage and honey, but you can’t go wrong with their 
          foldable take on a freshly made whole Margherita pie.

          </p>
          <p>
            Detroit may not be far but Torontonians need only journey to Leslieville 
            for rectangular pies in the style of the American city. Descendant 
            delights with toppings like pickled candied jalapeños, brisket, charred 
            fennel and pepperoni.

          <p>
            
            Locations across the city including ones on King West and Ossington 
            turn out these super quick-fired, personal size pies with elastic, 
            thin certified-Neapolitan-style crusts.

            </p>
            <p>
              Locations of this Toronto-based Italian empire (including the 
              original on Queen West) serve pizzas typically eaten knife-and-fork
               style individually. A whole section of their menu dedicated to 
               pizza alone typically boasts around 30 options for pies.

            <p>
              The original spot on Ossington has expanded with a takeout joint in
               Parkdale, both boasting not-so-secret speakeasy-style after-hours 
               back bars. Basic but well-executed pepperoni and anchovy knock it out
                of the park and Hawaiian ups the ante with spicy banana peppers, 
                mushroom pizza given a cream of mushroom base and crowned with 
                frilly arugula.
